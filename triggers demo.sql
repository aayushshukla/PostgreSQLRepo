/*
    A trigger in PostgreSQL is a database object that automatically executes a specified function 
	in response to certain events (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or TRUNCATE) on a table or view.

Triggers are commonly used for:

	Enforcing business rules
	Auditing changes
	Validating data
	Cascading operations

Types of Triggers in PostgreSQL
	1. Timing
	BEFORE: Trigger fires before the operation (can modify data).
	
	AFTER: Trigger fires after the operation (good for logging).
	
	INSTEAD OF: Used with views to simulate updates on them.

2. Events
	INSERT
	UPDATE
	DELETE
	TRUNCATE

3. Scope
	FOR EACH ROW: Trigger fires once per row affected.
	FOR EACH STATEMENT: Trigger fires once per SQL statement, regardless of rows affected.

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE}
ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW | FOR EACH STATEMENT]
EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_function_name();


NEW
	Represents the new row being inserted or updated.
	Available in: BEFORE INSERT, AFTER INSERT, BEFORE UPDATE, AFTER UPDATE, INSTEAD OF INSERT, INSTEAD OF UPDATE.

Use NEW when:
   Validating or modifying inserted/updated values.
   Logging or acting upon new values.


OLD
	Represents the existing row before it was updated or deleted.
	
	Available in: BEFORE UPDATE, AFTER UPDATE, BEFORE DELETE, AFTER DELETE, INSTEAD OF UPDATE, INSTEAD OF DELETE.
 Use OLD when:
	Comparing changes (e.g., OLD.title != NEW.title)
	Logging what was deleted or changed
	Archiving deleted data

Rules and practices 


	  Use BEFORE triggers to validate or modify data before writing to the table.
	   Use AFTER triggers for logging and audit trails, as the operation has succeeded.
	    Avoid long or complex operations inside triggers â€” they can slow down transactions.
	     Always return NEW or OLD from the trigger function depending on the type:
	   RETURN NEW; for INSERT or UPDATE
	    RETURN OLD; for DELETE

Test thoroughly: Trigger bugs are often hard to trace because they're invisible unless something goes wrong.
